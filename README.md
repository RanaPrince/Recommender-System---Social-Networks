# **Social Network Graph Link Prediction**

## **Overview**
This project focuses on predicting missing links in a directed social graph, enabling the recommendation of potential connections between users. The problem is modeled as a supervised machine learning task with extensive graph-based feature engineering and classification.

---

## **Problem Statement**
Given a directed social graph, the objective is to predict missing links (Link Prediction) to recommend users effectively.

## **Dataset**
- **Source:** [Facebook Recruiting Challenge on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/FacebookRecruiting)
- **Data Description:**
  - **Columns:** 
    - `source_node`: Starting node of the edge.
    - `destination_node`: Ending node of the edge.
  - Each row represents a directed edge in the graph.

---

## **Approach**

### 1. **Feature Engineering**
Extensive feature engineering was performed using graph-based properties:

#### **Graph-Based Features:**
- **Node-Level Metrics:**
  - Number of followers and followees.
  - Whether the user follows back (`follows_back`).
  - PageRank.
  - Katz centrality.
  - HITS scores (Hub and Authority).

- **Similarity Metrics:**
  - **Jaccard Similarity** for followers and followees.
  - **Cosine Similarity** for followers and followees.

- **Edge-Level Metrics:**
  - Weighted incoming and outgoing edges.
  - Preferential attachment (product of follower counts).

- **Community and Path-Based Metrics:**
  - Weakly connected components.
  - Shortest path between nodes.
  - Adamic-Adar index.

- **Matrix Decomposition (SVD):**
  - Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) features derived from the adjacency matrix of the graph.

## **Results**

### **Performance Metrics:**
| Metric               | Train Score | Test Score |
|-----------------------|-------------|------------|
| **F1 Score**          | 0.983       | 0.928      |
| **AUC (Test Data)**   | -           | 0.932      |

### **Feature Importance:**
The following features were found to be most important in predicting missing links:
1. `follows_back`
2. `cosine_followers`
3. `weight_f1`

SVD-based features had minimal importance.

---

### **Observations:**
1. The dataset likely represents a **directed social media graph** (e.g., Instagram or Twitter).
2. The model demonstrates high accuracy, precision, and recall for predicting missing links.
3. Key graph-based features like `follows_back` and `cosine_followers` significantly contribute to link prediction.

## **Visualization**
### **Confusion Matrix:**
The modelâ€™s performance was visualized using confusion matrices for both train and test datasets.

### **Feature Importance Plot:**
The top contributing features were highlighted using a bar chart.

### **ROC Curve:**
The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve showcased a high area under the curve (AUC).
